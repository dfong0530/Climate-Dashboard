### About

We are currently in the Anthropocene extinction period. The world has been detrimentally affected due to our behavior. If there isn't rapid change, there could be irreversable consequences. I created this dashboard to display up to date data on temperatures as well as methane emmisions within the United States.

The data is retrieved from multiple climate API's.

Single Components - Static Data.

Line Graph - Temperatures in the United States by year.

Donut Chart - Methane Emmisions in major cities in the US by year.
